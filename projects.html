      <a href="https://github.com/AndreaTerenz/Broca-translator" class="button">Broca-translator</a>
      <p class="justified"> Seq2Seq model for translation of (Broca) aphasic sentences into English. Project developed as part of the course of Natural Language Processing at the Reykjavik University.</p>
      <a href="https://github.com/marcoserenelli/MCCukoo" class="button">Malware Classification with Cuckoo Sandbox</a>
      <p class="justified">This project showcases the implementation of a malware classification project utilizing the Cuckoo sandbox. We collected diverse malware samples from various GitHub repositories, subjected them to analysis using the Cuckoo Sandbox, and explored a method for classifying them based on a defined set of features. This project served as the Final Project for the MLCS (Machine Learning in Cyber Security) course at Reykjavik University.</p>
      <a href="https://github.com/damiano00/T_710_MLCS_Machine_Learning_in_Cyber_Security/tree/main/intrusion_detection" class="button">Network Intrusion Detection</a>
      <p class="justified">Conducted thorough data preprocessing, including removal of leading/trailing spaces from column names and values, handling ”Infinity” and "NaN" values by replacing them with appropriate numerical limits. Implemented Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers, achieving an accuracy of 99.87% and 81.79%, respectively. Utilized scikit-learn for metrics and pandas for preprocessing in model evaluation. PyCharm and Jupyter are used as IDE and file format.</p>
      <a href="https://github.com/TBDM-Project/JanusGraph-API-example" class="button">JanusGraph-API</a>
      <p class="justified">Simple REST API implementation to query an instance of JanusGraph database, using Cassandra as backend storage. Developed as project of Technologies for Big Data Management exam in the Computer Science degree of University of Camerino.</p>
      <a href="https://github.com/damiano00/AlgorithmsAndDataStructuresProject" class="button">Algorithms and Data Structures</a>
      <p class="justified">Entirely developed Java library representing all the major graph researching algorithms like Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, etc., and all the major data structures used to represent graphs over memory, like binary heaps or adjacency lists. Project developed as part of Algorithms and Data Structures course at UNICAM</p>
      <a href="https://github.com/damiano00/ImageCatalogingSupport" class="button">Image Cataloging Support</a>
      <p class="justified">Group project started at UNICAM as a tool that aims to recognize faces and stamps inside of historical images. This tool makes use of Single Shot MUltibox Detector algorithm for objects recognition, and it is further trained over the dataset given by a local museum in Italy.</p>
      <a href="https://github.com/damiano00/CardGameLib" class="button">Card Game Library</a>
      <p class="justified">Java library representing a generic card game, with all the major components like cards, decks, players, etc. It includes a simple implementation of the famous game "Briscola". Project developed as part of Advanced Programming course ad UNICAM</p>
